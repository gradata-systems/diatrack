      <p>Diatrack is a web-based system that helps diabetics and their carers monitor blood sugar levels and keep track of treatment decisions and daily activities.</p>
      <p>It is designed to collect data from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) providers (like Dexcom) and give users more control over how they view and interact with their CGM data.</p>

      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>Diatrack is a <em>progressive web application</em> that can be accessed from a web browser on any desktop or mobile device.
        It can also be installed as an app on most devices, which creates an icon on your home screen. See a generic guide <a href="https://help.sugarmate.io/en/articles/5678010-faqs-sugarmate-and-dexcom-connection">here</a> that explains how to install a PWA.</p>

      <h2>What it does</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Continuously collects users' continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data.</li>
        <li>Provides a near-real-time graph and blood glucose readings.</li>
        <li>Allows multiple users to share the same datafeed from the one patient (Dexcom user) and see/edit a shared log, covering activities such as insulin bolus doses, pump basal adjustments and carbs consumed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>After a user signs in for the first time, they enter their Dexcom account details. Diatrack stores these securely and periodically uses these credentials to collect CGM data
        from Dexcom. The method of data access is similar to what Nightscout uses.</p>
      <p>The CGM data is stored on our servers and is queried by the user running the Diatrack web app.</p>
      <p>Access to CGM and user profile data is strictly controlled, in order to protect users' privacy and Dexcom account security.</p>
